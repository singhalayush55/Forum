            <h1>Income</h1>
            <img src="kasol2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The economy of Kasol was traditionally based on making baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. Marijuana was cultivated as a legal cash crop for centuries.Beginning in the 1980s, Kasol became a destination for recreational drug tourism.The village also produces maize and potatoes.While tourism is now a major source of income for the village, recently a ban has been placed preventing the tourists from staying overnight at the village.</p><br>
            <p>Apparently, this has been done to protect the village from corrupting influence of the outside world. As a result, hotels and guest houses by the outsiders have been closed down. Tourists can visit during daytime and leave before it is dark or they can stay in few home stays owned by locals.</p>
